# app_TODO
JQuery,CSS,HTML and javascript TODO List

This is going to be a practice to do list project from UDEMY tutorials.
This will teach me how to bind JQuery,Javascript and also a little more about Visual studio code and deployment maybe!
I am excited to complete this project, with pomodoro technique and also practice self discipline.

Description:
This is going to be a simple TODO list project which will also enable me to maintain a TODO list and make this a full flutter based project in near future after completing this course.

#TODO after this project: Node.js and Flutter.

Thanks, lets get started now may the force be with me!
